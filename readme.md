# 🛠️ Customer Support Ticket Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Customer Support Ticket Analysis Project** is designed to analyze and model customer support data for tech products.  
It leverages a structured dataset of support tickets containing customer information, product details, issue descriptions, ticket status, resolution history, and satisfaction ratings.  

The project aims to **improve customer service operations** by applying **data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP)** to extract insights, predict outcomes, and recommend solutions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer behavior and pain points through support tickets  
- Identify **common issues** across products and channels  
- Predict **customer satisfaction** and **ticket resolution time**  
- Automate ticket **classification and prioritization**  
- Develop data-driven strategies to **improve support processes**

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Ticket trends over time  
   - Common issues and frequent ticket types  
   - Distribution of customer demographics  

2. **Predictive Analytics**  
   - Estimate ticket resolution times  
   - Predict customer satisfaction ratings  

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Categorize tickets automatically based on descriptions  
   - Sentiment analysis of customer issues  

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Group customers by issues, product usage, and satisfaction  

5. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Suggest solutions or related products based on ticket context

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Use the provided Customer Support Ticket dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, anonymize sensitive info  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Identify key patterns and correlations  
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transform ticket details into features for modeling  
5. **Model Development**:  
   - Classification models for ticket type & priority  
   - Regression models for satisfaction and resolution time  
6. **Evaluation**: Measure model performance with accuracy, RMSE, F1-score  
7. **Visualization & Dashboarding**: Build insights dashboards for stakeholders
